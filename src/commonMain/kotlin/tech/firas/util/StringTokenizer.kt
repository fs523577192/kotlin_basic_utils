/**
 * The string tokenizer class allows an application to break a
 * string into tokens. The tokenization method is much simpler than
 * the one used by the `StreamTokenizer` class. The
 * `StringTokenizer` methods do not distinguish among
 * identifiers, numbers, and quoted strings, nor do they recognize
 * and skip comments.
 *
 *
 * The set of delimiters (the characters that separate tokens) may
 * be specified either at creation time or on a per-token basis.
 *
 *
 * An instance of `StringTokenizer` behaves in one of two
 * ways, depending on whether it was created with the
 * `returnDelims` flag having the value `true`
 * or `false`:
 *
 * * If the flag is `false`, delimiter characters serve to
 *     separate tokens. A token is a maximal sequence of consecutive
 *     characters that are not delimiters.
 * * If the flag is `true`, delimiter characters are themselves
 *     considered to be tokens. A token is thus either one delimiter
 *     character, or a maximal sequence of consecutive characters that are
 *     not delimiters.
 *
 *
 * A `StringTokenizer` object internally maintains a current
 * position within the string to be tokenized. Some operations advance this
 * current position past the characters processed.<p>
 * A token is returned by taking a substring of the string that was used to
 * create the `StringTokenizer` object.
 *
 *
 * The following is one example of the use of the tokenizer. The code:
 * ```
 *     val st = StringTokenizer("this is a test")
 *     while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {
 *         println(st.nextToken())
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 *
 * prints the following output:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     this
 *     is
 *     a
 *     test
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 *
 *
 * `StringTokenizer` is a legacy class that is retained for
 * compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is
 * recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the `split`
 * method of `String` or the java.util.regex package instead.
 *
 *
 * The following example illustrates how the `String.split`
 * method can be used to break up a string into its basic tokens:
 * ```
 *     val result: Array<String> = "this is a test".split("\\s")
 *     for (x in 0 until result.length)
 *         println(result[x])
 * ```
 *
 * prints the following output:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     this
 *     is
 *     a
 *     test
 * </pre></blockquote>
